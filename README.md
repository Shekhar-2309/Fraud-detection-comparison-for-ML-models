# Fraud Detection Comparision

- With the increasing prevalence of online transactions, the need for effective fraud detection systems has become paramount. This
  project focuses on developing a robust online fraud detection system employing three popular machine learning algorithms:
  Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), and Decision Tree.

- The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The project aims to
  compare and contrast the effectiveness of the three algorithms in detecting online fraud, considering factors like computational
  efficiency and interpretability.

- The PyCarat is automated library is used compare different model and predict the best model which has more efficiency and
  speed.

- The outcome of this project provides insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm, aiding in the selection of
  an appropriate model for online fraud detection based on specific requirements and constraints. The implementation of multiple
  algorithms contributes to the development of a comprehensive and adaptive fraud detection system, enhancing the security of
  online transactions
